This dataset includes distribution and abundance information of two invasive bivalves, Anadara kagoshimensis and A. transversa, in the Adriatic Sea. Data were obtained from an international experimental beam trawl survey that provides fishery-independent data (SoleMon project). Data from 66 trawling stations located in Italian and communitarian waters, collected between 2008 and 2023, were extracted. The dataset was collated, harmonised, and published through the CNR project USEit - Using operational synergies for the study and integrated management of invasive alien species in Italy.
