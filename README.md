This dataset includes distribution and abundance information of two invasive bivalves Anadara kagoshimensis and A. transversa in the Adriatic Sea. Data were obtained from an international experimental trawl survey that provides fishery independent data (SoleMon project). SoleMon has been operating annually since 2008 through a series of beam trawl surveys in the Northern Central Adriatic Sea. Data from 66 trawling stations located in Italian waters and collected between 2008 and 2023 were extracted, collated, harmonised and published through the CNR project USEit - Using operational synergies for the study and integrated management of invasive alien species in Italy.
